# So, a bit about me and this blog 

 Lately, I've found myself increasingly drawn to the idea of having my own tiny niche on the internet to amplify my voice. After dabbling with all the charming, custom-made Hugo and Jekyll themes—which swiftly became overwhelmingly disappointing tending to my pefectionist self — I've finally decided to embrace simplicity to actually set things forth. Unlike all those podcast aspirations that have taken a backseat for some time now. Here's to hoping I'll breathe life into them someday, with the same spontaneity that sparked this blog.
