# Of Goa Expedition, Interviews, and a Bow on Four Years

**Well, this cat cultist of yours is now (un)officially done with her uni, with only the convocation pending‚Äîthereby prompting me to gather all my tangled narrations into one place under ‚ÄúUni Stories,‚Äù or rather, a long, ending note on just how unbelievably transformative these four years have been. Signing my offer letter at Qualcomm today only reaffirmed how poetically this chapter has closed. full circle, no less.**

No, I didn‚Äôt achieve everything I set out to‚Äînot even close. What I thought these years would be like and what they actually became were rarely in sync. This place pushed me into situations I wouldn‚Äôt have touched with a ten-foot pole before‚Äîrealms of life I never imagined myself stumbling into. And yet, I discovered superpowers and stepfalls alike, in the most gruesome yet *perfectly splendid* ways. :3

Initially, I only meant to document my interviews avoiding spiraling into the personal emo jargon as I usually tend to, but of course, it was never going to stay that straightforward. The two interviews I *really* wanted to write about were **Google** and **Qualcomm**, both memorable, but for wildly different reasons.

### Google

I was already on a Google HR‚Äôs radar from an earlier open position, though I never heard back. Four months later (yes, I know it's embarassing), I finally followed up on a whim. Turns out, follow-ups *do* work. She replied a few weeks later saying the previous position had been filled internally but pitched me a **Silicon Engineer** role instead, the one I‚Äôd actually wanted all along. Caffeinated and ready, I went all in on prep.

Now, here‚Äôs where the timing gods decided to be cheeky. My uni friends and I had been planning a Goa trip for years which every semester's calling, every group project‚Äôs *intermidiatery thought* an the consolation *"reward"*. And of course, we‚Äôd finally locked dates, booked flights, sorted accommodation‚Ä¶ just in time for my Google interviews to land right in the middle of it all. Postponing wasn‚Äôt an option either, thanks to the long Holi weekend right after our return. The timing was so exquisitely terrible that it almost felt orchestrated. 

I seriously debated skipping the trip entirely, the role was tempting afterall. Three days to decide between professional aspirations and the sunk cost fallacy of non-refundable bookings. Not to mention the deluded four year long *‚ÄúGoa chalte hain‚Äù*‚Äòs silent tug at my now guilt laces loyalties. 

What followed was the quite a *surreal week* with days spent admist Goan beaches on days, sleepy yet oddly euphoric karaoke car rides, every night was an all-nighters spent coding, and frantic revision sessions in the living room I‚Äôd all but colonised. I did feel, *unironically*, alive. Working towards something I actually wanted, all while getting a break from my usual spiral of panic (I‚Äôm annoyingly prone to it).

The evening I flew back, I had my **first interview**. It was straightforward enough, but between the sleep deprivation, the suddeneness of it, and well, might be a bit of rushed-prep toped with performance anxiety after everything I‚Äôd just emerged from (T.T), I stumbled during the latter half while being questioned in details about Static and Dynamic Power losses. Just as the interview ended, that sinking feeling of having botched the opportunity hit hard, even if, in hindsight, it probably wasn‚Äôt as catastrophic as it felt.

Still slept like a baby that night.

Next few days went into prep for the next round. 
**The second interview** was me gliding with ease. Programming, Verilog , comparc and digital had been my well-prepared suites. I was sharp, centered, and knew I‚Äôd done it justice. The interviewer made me feel comfortable and was quite friendly allowing me the time to think and process. I logged out of the meet satisfied, already knowing the first interview was going to be the bottleneck.(If I was in denial during the past few days, it became clear there and then)

The rejection email hit exactly as hard as you'd expect. *‚ÄúHeartbreaking‚Äù* feels almost quaint‚Äîbut it'll do.

I wouldn't pinpoint the reason it slipped. My ego however, the bruising was .. well .. substantial.

But the thing was, I didn‚Äôt regret a second of it. Not the grind, not the interviews, not even the bizarre logistics of this crunch induced vacay. Having rediscovered what it felt like to want something enough to chase it without abstaning from things I indeed want to do in the name of ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù as I've always done.

### Qualcomm

Turns out, that chaotic prep wasn‚Äôt for nothing. The Qualcomm opportunity arrived out of nowhere in the middle of saree debates and farewell photo shoot logistics (P.S. I was awarded ‚ÄúMost likely to be late to her own wedding‚Äù‚Äîa deeply accurate honor). STA wasn‚Äôt a domain I‚Äôd felt comfortable in earlier; it had always challenged me, and growing into it had been slow, ~mostly~ sometimes painful.

But looking back, this didn‚Äôt feel coincidental. It felt like something that was meant to catch me when I wasn‚Äôt trying so hard.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I did this alone. A friend who helped me patch over the concepts I‚Äôd missed or glossed over before, in an entire day with him racking his brains for(and on) on me. And to the one who referred me, Thank you for seeing what I hadn‚Äôt yet found the words for. <33

This time it was offline and that played right to my strengths (am someone who feels more comfortable and confident with in-person interview). It had 3 techinal and an HR round, HR one being online and on a 30 mins notice. All the interviews I had here were really interactive and the people so were passionate about what they were working on, it ended up inspiring me a lot. Well, I‚Äôm writing this one since I ended up getting the role and am going with. It was quite joyous the moment I got the news and a positive feeling :)

Here‚Äôs a peek into what the interviews looked like, for anyone curious or prepping.

### üìã Interview Breakdown

#### Google

**Interview 1**  
- CMOS Design: PMOS, NMOS logic, PUN/PDN  
- CMOS Power Consumption: Static & Dynamic Loss (causation and effects)  
- CMOS Physical design, Effects observed and nuances, ELL211 later leaning into analog

**Interview 2**  
- Basics of Digital (incl Bit manipulations)  
- Digital Design Problems  
- Problem Statements with Verilog and optimization
- Other logic improvs or possible implementations shortcommings in depth.

---

#### Qualcomm

**Interview 1**  
- Extensive Digital Design Questions  
- STA: Timing delays, setup/hold times, clock frequencies  
- Verilog Problems  
- Questions based on Resume  
- Cadence Virtuoso exposure

**Interview 2**  
- Resume discussions mostly: BTP, projects, internships, PORs  
- TCL/PERL scripting  
- FIFO depth calculations  
- Timing Delay-centric problems

**Interview 3**  
This round was particularly for assesing technical intuition and problem-solving approach. Less about specific knowledge, more about how you think through complex system design challenges and behavioural fit. 


**Interview 4 (HR + Technical)**  
- Behavioral assesment and  Academic backgrounds
- System design Flow in VLSI 
- Hardware/software design life cycle

#### Concluding Note 

Huff.. So there‚Äôs that. Recollecting is like going down the rollercoaster all over again. And sometimes the universe's timing is more sophisticated than what an immediate analysis would suggests.

Many of such tales, (not all are academic :p) both bitter and sweet scripted a story that wrapped itself into a neat, imperfect little bow. Not every arc ended in success, but every stumble taught me more about what I want, what I can survive, and what truly drives me. This journey has been a flavourful kind of disaster. I didn‚Äôt just walk out of college with an offer, I walked out with memories, bonds sculpted with moments, The right kind of freedom, knowing I still burn for the chase. I know I want more, but the uncertainty isn‚Äôt scaring me as much as it used to. And maybe, just maybe, that‚Äôs worth more than the checkboxed wins I thought I was here for.
