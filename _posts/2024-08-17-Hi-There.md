# So, a bit about me and this blog 

 Lately, I've found myself increasingly drawn to the idea of having my own tiny niche on the internet to express myself. After dabbling with all the charming, custom-made Hugo and Jekyll themesâ€”which became overwhelmingly disappointing quite fast tending to my pefectionist self, I've decided to embrace simplicity to actually set things forth, unlike all those podcast aspirations that have taken a backseat for some time now. Here's to hoping I'll breathe life into them someday, with the same spontaneity that sparked this blog. 
 
 This sudden burst of spontaneity, as you might guess, came with recent happenings as I claim the night as mine.
